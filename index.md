I am a research associate at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC. I have a broad range of research interests and I currently work on migration, urban economics, food aid reform, maritime policy, and agricutlure policy. You can find my work at AEI [here](https://www.aei.org/profile/phil-hoxie/). I hold a BA from Middlebury College in Vermont. 

I plan to use this site to host interactive content from reports done in collaboration with coauthors. If you have any questions about my work, reach out to philip.hoxie@aei.org.
